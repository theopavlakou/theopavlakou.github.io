				I have decided to start writing some of my notes online. The reason for
				this is because: (a) I can see them whenever I have an internet
				connection wherever I may be and (b) maybe there are some poor souls out
				there that are also finding some concepts hard to grasp and just need
				another perspective on them.

				This means that I will only be writing up posts that I believe are
				not really well covered on the internet in a fashion that is accessible
				to a Masters student doing a CS degree. So, this is not the place to
				be, if you want to learn all there is to know about Deep Learning,
				because there are loads of resources online for that and they are great
				(and also, it's not really my area of expertise at all).

				A lot of the stuff I'll go through takes concepts from books like
				<q>Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</q> by Kevin Murpy and
				makes kind of makes them a little less dense and little more intuitive
				(at least to me). Other posts will just focus on things that I have
				come across during my PhD that I have understood in my own way, which
				may be helpful to others as well. So, without further ado, below are
				some of my posts to date.
